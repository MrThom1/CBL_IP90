We created a 1v1 soccergame named BoCo. (Bosma + Coolen)
The game is intended to be played on a 1920x1080 screen.
If you want to start the game, u have to run "Handler.java".
When the game is opened, you can choose whether you want to play singleplayer or multiplayer.
If you choose to play singleplayer, you will play against a bot.
If you choose to play multiplayer, you can play with a friend (or someone else). 
To move player 1 (the purple one), use the "wasd" keys on your keyboard.
To move player 2 (the red one), use the arrow keys on your keyboard.
The bot player moves by itself.
The players are able to move with more than 1 key at the same time, 
for example: Player 1 can move to top right by using "w" and "d" at the same time.

Both the singleplayer game, as well as the mutliplayer game last 2 minutes.
In these 2 minutes both players, or the player and the bot, have to score as much goals as possible in eachothers goal, 
while defending their own goal!
When a goal is scored, the ball and the players will be spawned back in the middle of the field.
At the top of the screen you can see the scoreboard with the scores of both teams.
The player who scores the most goals within the 2 minute timer, wins the game!

When the game ends, the endscreen will show up.
On the endscreen you can see who won, in case you were not paying attention to the scoreboard.
The endscreen also has a button to go back to the startscreen.

2. User Experience (UX)

We have made our game easy to play for our users.
Below I will list some reasons why BoCo has a good user experience:

- BoCo is a singleplayer AND multiplayer game.
We started BoCo with just a multiplayer version, to have fun with someone else. Multiplayer games can be really competitive, engaging and will also 	give players the opportunity to challenge their friends. But then we thought about how we can better the user experience. 
Since you're not always with other people that want to play the game, we decided that adding a second gamemode would improve the user experience drastically. 
This gamemode contains a bot which allows the user to also play the game in a singleplayer environment. 
Offering the user more possibilities will result in a higher user satisfaction.

- BoCo has a balanced bot.
The bot you can play against if you play singleplayer is well balanced. 
The bot is pretty hard to get past and score against, but it's not too difficult.
Playing against this bot is also a good way to practice for the user. 
The user can practice against the bot to get better and eventually win against his friends. 

- You can play BoCo everywhere.
You don't need internet to play BoCo. You don't even need internet to play with your friends, because you can both play on the same device. 
The fact that you don't need internet to play BoCo, ensures that the user can play whenever and wherever they want to play.

- The graphics are beautiful.
BoCo uses custom images for our start screen, end screen, soccer field, players, bot, ball, scoreboard and buttons.
We chose to use bright colors so that everything, that is important, stands out and is clear. For our players we used the colors purple and red. 
These colors really pop out of the green field in the background.

- BoCo is easy to play.
We allow the players to control their characters with standard keyboard inputs ("WASD" and the arrow keys).
These keys get used in a lot of games and that is the reason why it will enhance the user experience.

- The players and bot move smoothly.
We made sure our code makes the players move smoothly, and not choppy.
This is much better to look at for the user and the user will enjoy the game more.

- BoCo has an ingame scoreboard.
The score is automatically updated on the scoreboard at the top of the screen. 
The user doesn't have to remember the score or write the score down.
The score system makes sure that the players can follow their progress and can compete with their opponent effectively.
When a player is losing, they will probably play differently than when they are winning. 

- The core features of BoCo are scalable.
The background with the borders are scalable. The text, for example the score and the timer are not scalable. 
So there is still room for improvement on this field.

- The games are time-limited.
Our games are short and exciting, because of our 2 minute timer at the top of the screen.
The user is less likely to lose interest and will be more likely to play a rematch, because the game won't take long.

- Respawn after a goal is scored.
The gameplay gets sped up, because of our automatic respawn function. 
After a goal is scored, the players and ball will be reset to the middle of the field and can imidiately start playing again. 
This minimizes the downtime and maximizes the user experience.

- Useful endscreen.
Our game provides an endscreen that announces the winner, which will bring closure to the game and clearly displays the outcome.
Because of our button on the endscreen, that makes the user go back to the startscreen, you will not have to restart the game.
If you want to play a rematch against your friend, you can just start a new game via those buttons, in stead of rerunning the code.
